= Shapes library for Prawn

Available thus far:
- star
- half_star
- arc
- pie_slice
- half_circle
- quarter_circle

= Usage

Install the prawn_shapes gem, then:

  require 'prawn_shapes'

And:

  pdf.star([x, y], :radius => r)

  pdf.arc_around([x, y], :radius => r, :start_angle => 30, :end_angle => 60)
  pdf.pie_slice([x, y], :radius => r, :start_angle => 45, :end_angle => 135)
  pdf.half_circle([x, y], :radius => r, :side => :left)
  pdf.quarter_circle([x, y], :radius => r, :quadrant => 3)

The built in prawn magic works:

  pdf.stroke_star([x, y], :radius => r)
  pdf.fill_star([x, y], :radius => r)
  pdf.fill_and_stroke_star([x, y], :radius => r)

See the examples directory for further usage examples.
